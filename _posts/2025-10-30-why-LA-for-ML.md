- explain how LA came to use in ML and AI.
- McCulloch-pitts was the first artificial model of biological neuron, and it was linear because that is close to how real neuron works.

Why linearity?

Two conclusions I came to:
- First it is easy to find linear relationship, e.g., least squares or PCA. There is only one solution, you just find that particular solution. That is, there is only one way to establish linear relationship. On the other hand, there are many ways you can find the non-linear relationship.
- Second, it is highly interpretable. You know which variables impact how much to the result.
